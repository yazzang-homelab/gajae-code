# Bash tool runtime

This document describes the **`bash` tool** runtime path used by agent tool calls, from command normalization to execution, truncation/artifacts, and rendering.

It also calls out where behavior diverges in interactive TUI, print mode, ACP, and user-initiated bang (`!`) shell execution.

## Scope and runtime surfaces

There are two different bash execution surfaces in coding-agent:

1. **Tool-call surface** (`toolName: "bash"`): used when the model calls the bash tool.
   - Entry point: `BashTool.execute()`.
   - Parameters include `command`, optional `env`, `timeout`, `cwd`, `pty`, and, when `async.enabled` is true, `async`.
2. **User bang-command surface** (`!cmd` from interactive input): session-level helper path.
   - Entry point: `AgentSession.executeBash()`.

Both eventually use `executeBash()` in `src/exec/bash-executor.ts` for non-PTY execution, but only the tool-call path runs normalization/interception, optional managed background-job handling, and tool renderer logic.

## End-to-end tool-call pipeline

## 1) Input handling and parameter merge

`BashTool.execute()` currently handles input before execution as follows:

- validates optional `env` names against shell-variable syntax,
- extracts a leading `cd <path> && ...` into `cwd` when `cwd` was not supplied,
- rejects `async: true` when `async.enabled` is false,
- optionally removes harmless trailing `| head ...` / `| tail ...` limiters through `applyBashFixups()` when `bash.stripTrailingHeadTail` is enabled,
- leaves output-window selection to `OutputSink`: a 1 KiB tail by default, an explicitly configured `tools.artifactTailBytes` tail budget, or head+tail when `tools.artifactHeadBytes` is explicitly configured.

## 2) Optional interception (blocked-command path)

If `bashInterceptor.enabled` is true, `BashTool` loads rules from settings and runs `checkBashInterception()` against the normalized command.

Interception behavior:

- command is blocked **only** when:
  - regex rule matches, and
  - the suggested tool is present in `ctx.toolNames`.
- invalid regex rules are silently skipped.
- on block, `BashTool` throws `ToolError` with message:
  - `Blocked: ...`
  - original command included.

Default rule patterns (defined in code) target common misuses:

- file readers (`cat`, `head`, `tail`, ...)
- search tools (`grep`, `rg`, ...)
- file finders (`find`, `fd`, ...)
- in-place editors (`sed -i`, `perl -i`, `awk -i inplace`)
- shell redirection writes (`echo ... > file`, heredoc redirection)

### Caveat

`InterceptionResult` includes `suggestedTool`, but `BashTool` currently surfaces only the message text (no structured suggested-tool field in `details`).

## 3) CWD validation and timeout clamping

`cwd` is resolved relative to session cwd (`resolveToCwd`), then validated via `stat`:

- missing path -> `ToolError("Working directory does not exist: ...")`
- non-directory -> `ToolError("Working directory is not a directory: ...")`

Timeout is clamped to `[1, 3600]` seconds and converted to milliseconds.

## 4) Artifact allocation

Before execution, the tool allocates an artifact path/id (best-effort) for truncated output storage.

- artifact allocation failure is non-fatal (execution continues without artifact spill file),
- artifact id/path are passed into execution path for full-output persistence on truncation.

## 5) PTY vs non-PTY execution selection

`BashTool` chooses PTY execution only when all are true:

- tool input `pty === true`
- `GJC_NO_PTY !== "1"`
- tool context has UI (`ctx.hasUI === true` and `ctx.ui` set)

Otherwise it uses non-interactive `executeBash()`.

That means print mode and non-UI tool contexts always use non-PTY.

## Non-interactive execution engine (`executeBash`)

## Shell session reuse model

`executeBash()` caches native `Shell` instances in a process-global map keyed by:

- shell path,
- configured command prefix,
- snapshot path,
- serialized shell env,
- optional agent session key.

Session-level bang-command executions pass `sessionKey: this.sessionId`.

Tool-call executions pass `sessionKey: this.session.getSessionId?.()`, when available. In both surfaces, a session key isolates shell reuse per session; without one, reuse falls back to shell config/snapshot/env.

## Shell config and snapshot behavior

At each call, executor loads settings shell config (`shell`, `env`, optional `prefix`).

If selected shell includes `bash`, it attempts `getOrCreateSnapshot()`:

- snapshot captures aliases/functions/options from user rc,
- snapshot creation is best-effort,
- failure falls back to no snapshot.

If `prefix` is configured, command becomes:

```text
<prefix> <command>
```

## Streaming and cancellation

`Shell.run()` streams chunks to `OutputSink` and optional `onChunk` callback.

Cancellation:

- aborted signal triggers `shellSession.abort(...)`,
- timeout from native result is mapped to `cancelled: true` + annotation text,
- explicit cancellation similarly returns `cancelled: true` + annotation.

No exception is thrown inside executor for timeout/cancel; it returns structured `BashResult` and lets caller map error semantics.

## Interactive PTY path (`runInteractiveBashPty`)

When PTY is enabled, tool runs `runInteractiveBashPty()` which opens an overlay console component and drives a native `PtySession`.

Behavior highlights:

- xterm-headless virtual terminal renders viewport in overlay,
- keyboard input is normalized (including Kitty sequences and application cursor mode handling),
- `esc` while running kills the PTY session,
- terminal resize propagates to PTY (`session.resize(cols, rows)`).

Environment hardening defaults are injected for unattended runs:

- pagers disabled (`PAGER=cat`, `GIT_PAGER=cat`, etc.),
- editor prompts disabled (`GIT_EDITOR=true`, `EDITOR=true`, ...),
- terminal/auth prompts reduced (`GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0`, `SSH_ASKPASS=/usr/bin/false`, `CI=1`),
- package-manager/tool automation flags for non-interactive behavior.

PTY output is normalized (`CRLF`/`CR` to `LF`, `sanitizeText`) and written into `OutputSink`, including artifact spill support.

On PTY startup/runtime error, sink receives `PTY error: ...` line and command finalizes with undefined exit code.

## Output handling: streaming, truncation, artifact spill

Both PTY and non-PTY paths use `OutputSink`.

## OutputSink semantics

- keeps a small in-memory UTF-8-safe tail buffer (1 KiB by default),
- uses an explicitly configured `tools.artifactTailBytes` value to set the Bash tail budget,
- retains no head window by default; explicitly configuring `tools.artifactHeadBytes` opts Bash into head+tail middle elision,
- tracks total bytes/lines seen,
- if an artifact path exists and output overflows (or the file is already active), writes the stream up to the artifact hard cap; any omitted bytes are counted and disclosed instead of calling the artifact complete,
- when memory threshold overflows, trims the in-memory buffer to the tail (UTF-8 boundary safe),
- marks `truncated` when overflow/file spill occurs.

`dump()` returns:

- `output` (possibly annotated prefix),
- `truncated`,
- `totalLines/totalBytes`,
- `outputLines/outputBytes`,
- `artifactId` if artifact file was active,
- `artifactTruncatedBytes` when the artifact hard cap omitted bytes,
- `sourceTruncatedBytes` when the native shell path omitted bytes before the Bash executor received them.
- `sourceCaptureIncomplete` when a native reader, cancellation/timeout cleanup, client-owned terminal capture, or loss counter cannot prove complete exact source capture.

### Long-output caveat

`BashTool` supplies a 1 KiB byte threshold to `OutputSink` by default, overridden by an explicit `tools.artifactTailBytes` setting. Direct user bang commands continue to use the executor's shared 50 KiB tail plus configured head window. Neither path enforces a hard line-count cap.

The native shell path bounds both the core-to-native relay and the actual N-API callback queue at 1,024 entries and applies backpressure instead of dropping queue-full chunks. The core callback stream keeps an 8 MiB prefix budget; output beyond it is reduced to a UTF-8-safe 64 KiB terminal tail, with at most one typed aggregate loss marker inserted before that tail and exact dropped chunk/byte metadata returned within JavaScript's safe integer range. Counter saturation is surfaced as incomplete capture instead of an exact claim. Final status tokens therefore remain observable. Bash results carrying loss or unsettled-capture metadata remain truncated, notices identify an incomplete Bash capture instead of inventing original-source line coordinates, and any artifact reference is labeled as retained partial output rather than full output.

## Live tool updates and async jobs

Foreground streamed updates, PTY capture, managed async jobs, and monitor jobs all use the Bash retention policy resolved from the active `ToolSession`: a 1 KiB UTF-8-safe tail by default, an explicit `tools.artifactTailBytes` tail budget, and optional `tools.artifactHeadBytes` head retention for final captured output. Foreground, async, and monitor progress callbacks use bounded tail previews; PTY live rendering remains in the custom overlay while its final capture uses the same `OutputSink` budgets.

When `async.enabled` is true and the call passes `async: true`, `BashTool` starts a managed Bash job, returns a running job result with a job id, and stores bounded completion output through the session managed-job path. Auto-backgrounding can start the same path after `bash.autoBackground.thresholdMs`.

### ACP client-terminal retention

When the connected client owns terminal execution, GJC requests the same bounded Bash output contract through `outputByteLimit`:

- the default request retains the last 1 KiB; ACP truncates from the beginning at a UTF-8 character boundary,
- an explicit `tools.artifactTailBytes` value sets that requested tail limit,
- an explicit `tools.artifactHeadBytes` value omits the client-side byte limit so GJC can receive the complete returned stream, apply local head+tail middle elision, and save the full returned output when artifact storage is available,
- if the client itself reports `truncated: true`, the returned bytes are already incomplete and GJC does not label an artifact made from that partial value as the full capture,
- poll updates and timeout output use the same local retention policy; a complete oversized timeout capture is saved before the bounded error is surfaced when artifact storage is available.

For an ACP result where the client reports `truncated: true`, a truncation notice without an `artifact://` link means GJC never received the full stream. Separately, when artifact allocation is unavailable, a complete local capture can remain without a link or diagnostic because SDK allocation wrappers may return an empty value; if an artifact writer/save operation is attempted and fails, it emits a bounded diagnostic without inventing an artifact URI.

## Result shaping, metadata, and error mapping

After execution:

1. `cancelled` handling:
   - if abort signal is aborted -> throw `ToolAbortError` (abort semantics),
   - else -> throw `ToolError` (treated as tool failure).
2. PTY `timedOut` -> throw `ToolError`.
3. retain only the final 1 KiB output window by default (or use explicit `tools.artifactTailBytes` / `tools.artifactHeadBytes` retention budgets).
4. empty output becomes `(no output)`.
5. attach truncation metadata via `toolResult(...).truncationFromSummary(result, { direction: "tail" })`.
6. exit-code mapping:
   - missing exit code -> `ToolError("... missing exit status")`
   - non-zero exit -> `ToolError("... Command exited with code N")`
   - zero exit -> success result.

Success payload structure:

- `content`: text output,
- `details.meta.truncation` when truncated, including:
  - `direction`, `truncatedBy`, total/output line+byte counts,
  - `shownRange` only when the captured stream has complete source coordinates,
  - `artifactId`, `artifactTruncatedBytes`, `sourceTruncatedBytes`, `sourceCaptureIncomplete`, and `artifactFailureDiagnostic` when available.

Because built-in tools are wrapped with `wrapToolWithMetaNotice()`, truncation notice text is appended to final text content automatically. Complete references use `Read artifact://<id> for full output`; source-loss, unsettled-capture, and storage-cap references use `Read artifact://<id> for retained output (...)` with every known omission disclosed.

## Rendering paths

## Tool-call renderer (`bashToolRenderer`)

`bashToolRenderer` is used for tool-call messages (`toolCall` / `toolResult`):

- collapsed mode shows visual-line-truncated preview,
- expanded mode shows all currently available output text,
- warning line includes the truncation reason and, when metadata has one, its `artifact://<id>` reference,
- timeout value (from args) is shown in footer metadata line.

### Caveat: full artifact expansion

`BashRenderContext` has `isFullOutput`, but current renderer context builder does not set it for bash tool results. Expanded view still uses the text already in result content (tail/truncated output) unless another caller provides full artifact content.

## User bang-command component (`BashExecutionComponent`)

`BashExecutionComponent` is for user `!` commands in interactive mode (not model tool calls):

- streams chunks live,
- collapsed preview keeps last 20 logical lines,
- line clamp at 4000 chars per line,
- shows truncation + artifact warnings when metadata is present,
- marks cancelled/error/exit state separately.

This component is wired by `CommandController.handleBashCommand()` and fed from `AgentSession.executeBash()`.

## Mode-specific behavior differences

| Surface                        | Entry path                                            | PTY eligible                                                         | Live output UX                                                           | Error surfacing                                  |

| Interactive tool call          | `BashTool.execute`                                    | Yes, when `pty=true` and UI exists and `GJC_NO_PTY!=1`                | PTY overlay (interactive) or streamed tail updates                       | Tool errors become `toolResult.isError`          |

## Operational caveats

- Interceptor only blocks commands when suggested tool is currently available in context.
- If artifact allocation/storage is unavailable before a writer/save operation is attempted, truncation still occurs without an `artifact://` back-reference and may have no diagnostic because SDK allocation wrappers can return an empty value. If a writer/save operation is attempted and fails, Bash emits a bounded diagnostic; it never fabricates a reference.
- Shell session cache has no explicit eviction in this module; lifetime is process-scoped.
- PTY and non-PTY timeout surfaces differ:
  - PTY exposes explicit `timedOut` result field,
  - non-PTY maps timeout into `cancelled + annotation` summary.
